Project: Design a store database  

Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.

This exercise allowed me to demonstrate my ability to create and store information in a database and then extract some information from that database. 

It is meant as a starting point in my learning of SQL.
